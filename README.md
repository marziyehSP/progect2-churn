#Churn Modeling
This project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using logistic regression and neural network models. The goal is to determine whether a customer is likely to stay or leave the bank's services based on various features.
##Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
RowNumber: The row number in the dataset
CustomerId: Unique identifier for each customer
Surname: Customer's surname
CreditScore: Customer's credit score
Geography: Customer's geographic location
Gender: Customer's gender
Age: Customer's age
Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank
Balance: Customer's account balance
NumOfProducts: Number of bank products the customer has
HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 for yes, 0 for no)
IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active bank member (1 for yes, 0 for no)
EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the customer
Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1 for yes, 0 for no)
##Results
After implementing the logistic regression and neural network models, the following results were achieved:
Logistic Regression:
Test Accuracy: 69.93%
Neural Network:
Test Accuracy: 74.26%
